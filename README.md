# AI adventurer

Supposed to be an AI storyteller, where you give input through a terminal (CLI)
GUI to an AI Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, to get the story going.

This is written to get an understanding of NLP, so don't expect too much.

The AI model is local, so it runs offline. It is therefore a simple, distilled
GPT2 model, to be able to run on a laptop.

## Setup

```
poetry build
poetry run run.py
```

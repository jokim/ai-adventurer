# AI adventurer

Supposed to be an AI storyteller, where you give input through a terminal (CLI)
GUI to an AI Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, to get the story going.

This is written to get an understanding of NLP, so don't expect too much.

I tested a local AI model, but since a simple laptop can't do much, I also
tested various online AI services, like OpenAI and Googles Gemini.


## Setup

```
poetry run ai_adventurer/run.py
